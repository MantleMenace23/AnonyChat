        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! This is a personal project I built as a student in the district.
            My goal was to create something safe, clean, and useful for my friends
            and classmates.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>Chat:</strong> A private chat tool that makes it easier to
                collaborate on school projects, especially for students without phones
                or who find email slow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Games:</strong> A small collection of simple games meant
                purely for entertainment at home. There’s a disclaimer at the top of
                the games page reminding students not to use them during school hours.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project is mainly about learning, coding, and creating something
            helpful. The games are just an extra feature for fun outside of school.
